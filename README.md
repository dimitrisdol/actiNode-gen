# actinode-gen
 Generates an actiNode CRD with informers,clienset and listers. We also provide an extra k8s-client to create our custom CRDs (4 Objects in total)

## Description
 Firstly an ApiExtension is created with kube-builder that enabled the usage of a CRD, namely ActiNode. That ActiNode CRD allows the create of custom Objects that will desribe the current cluster Nodes available (//TODO: it is only hardcoded will need file input).
 Then with the use of code-generator, we created listers, informers and a clientset.
 Lastly a Kubernetes client is developed that creates the first 4 Custom

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
cd k8s-client
KUBE_NAMESPACE='default' go run .
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/actinode-gen:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/actinode-gen:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
kubectl -f config/crd/bases/
```
That way you create the CRD.

2. (NOT AVAILABLE NOW)Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
